# Library System

## Description
The Library System is a console-based program that replicates a standard public library. A structured menu will prompt the user with what actions they'd like to perform. These actions include adding a book to the library, registering a patron, checking out a book, returning a book, printing all books, printing all patrons, printing a patron's borrowing history, and printing all library transactions. The program continues to display until the user chooses to exit. Once prompted to exit, the program will end. The program was coded in Java using the Eclipse IDE.
